                <h3 id="about">Why Choose Yoga</h3>
                <p id="info">The true essence of yoga revolves around elevating the life force or "Kundalini" at the base of the spine. It aims to achieve this through a series of physical and mental exercises. At the physical level, the methods comprise various yoga postures or "asanas" that aim to keep the body healthy. The mental techniques include breathing exercises or "pranayama" and meditation or "dhyana" to discipline the mind.

                <h3 id="about">Importance of Yoga</h3>
                <p id="info">Yoga is not a religion; it is a way of living that aims towards "a healthy mind in a healthy body". Man is a physical, mental and spiritual being; yoga helps promote a balanced development of all the three. Other forms of physical exercises, like aerobics, assure only physical well-being. They have little to do with the development of the spiritual or astral body.</p>
                <h3 id="about">Benefits of Yoga</h3>
                <p id="info">The art of practicing yoga helps in controlling an individual's mind, body and soul. It brings together physical and mental disciplines to achieve a peaceful body and mind; it helps manage stress and anxiety and keeps you relaxing. It also helps in increasing flexibility, muscle strength and body tone. It improves respiration, energy and vitality. Practicing yoga might seem like just stretching, but it can do much more for your body from the way you feel, look and move.
                </p>
                <h3 id="about">Tradition</h3>
                <p id="info">"Yoga is an invaluable gift of India's ancient tradition. This tradition is 5000 years old. It embodies the unity of mind and body; thought and action; restraint and fulfillment; harmony between man and the nature; a holistic approach to health and well-being. It is not about exercise but to discover the sense of oneness with yourself, the world and the nature. By changing our lifestyle and creating consciousness, it can help in well-being. Let us work towards adopting an International Yoga Day." - Narendra Modi, UN General Assembly, September 2014.
